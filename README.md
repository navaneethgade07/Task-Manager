# Nodejs and expressjs Project
### Using Mongodb atlas
- This is  only a backend project for the Task_manager which is similar to **To_do_list**.

- But here we used mongodb Database and mongodb Atlas as a  cloud platform  for deployment.

- Used Mongoose which provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

## Installation
-      npm install expressjs mongoose
    - This will install all the package's of mongoose and expressjs

-       npm install nodemon
    - nodemon is used to start your sever automatically when changes are made


## usage
- Develop an frontend application for Task_Manager and connect these folders
- As some changes can be made based on your requirements
